🌟 1️⃣ Visual Style & Design Language

✅ Minimal & Clean: Lots of white space, flat icons, and easy-to-read typography.
✅ Modern Colors:
	•	Primary color: Deep blue or teal (calming, medical feel).
	•	Secondary: Soft gray and accents of bright green or coral for CTAs (call-to-action).
✅ Rounded Corners: Use generous border-radius for input fields, buttons, and cards.
✅ Shadows & Depth: Subtle drop shadows to highlight interactive elements (like cards and buttons).
✅ Consistent Iconography: Use simple line icons (like Lucide or Heroicons) to keep things visually cohesive.
