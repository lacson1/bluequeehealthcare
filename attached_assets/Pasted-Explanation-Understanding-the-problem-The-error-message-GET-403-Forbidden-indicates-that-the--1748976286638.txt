Explanation

Understanding the problem
The error message GET ... 403 (Forbidden) indicates that the server understood your request but refused to authorize it. This is often due to insufficient permissions or invalid authentication.

How to verify
Check the "Network" tab in Chrome DevTools. Find the failed request to /api/organizations.
Examine the "Headers" tab for this request. Pay close attention to the "Request Headers," particularly the Authorization header.
Confirm that the Authorization header is present and contains a valid token or credentials.
Suggested fix
The server is rejecting the request because the user is not authorized to access the /api/organizations endpoint. This typically means the provided authentication credentials (likely in the Authorization header) are missing, invalid, or do not have the necessary permissions.

You need to ensure that the request is being made with valid credentials for a user or service account that has the required permissions on the server-side to access the /api/organizations resource. This might involve:

Checking your authentication token: Ensure the token is correctly generated and not expired.
Verifying user permissions: Confirm that the user associated with the token has permission to access the requested resource.
Ensuring the token is sent correctly: Make sure the Authorization header is formatted correctly (e.g., Bearer your_token).
The provided code snippet shows part of a fetch call, but the exact location where the Authorization header is set is not visible. You'll need to find where you are setting the request headers for this specific fetch call and ensure the Authorization header is correctly included with valid credentials.

Summary
A 403 Forbidden error means the server is preventing access to a resource due to insufficient authorization. To fix this, ensure your request includes valid authentication credentials with the necessary permissions to access the requested endpoint.
